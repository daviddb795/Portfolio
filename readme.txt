--Readme document for David Brown's Portfolio--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
I included the basic tags for for text size, an image, footer, list items for the navigation on the nav-bar.


(b) CSS features
I used bootstrap which allowed me to use things like container-fluid and the new height / justify tags that go along with it. I used height/width/margin/padding when needed along with font size that adjust to the size of the screen. I also used this to set background and text colors along with the font style which I imported in from Google fonts.


(c) Advanced features
I used a text animation tutorial that I found from css-tricks.com that allowed for the typewriter effect at the top of my page. However the tutorial that I found only allowed for one line of text so I had to do some additional searching to figure out how to hide and delay the second line of text until it was supposed to appear on the screen. I also made use of the font awesome icons to link to my GitHub, LinkedIn and gmail.


2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
10 - 15 hours I am thinking but could be more due to the amount of reading I had to do to understand how bootstrap worked along with some of the other features.


3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/
https://stackoverflow.com/ - this I mostly used to peace together the parts of my site that were otherwise not working the way I wanted them too.


4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I didn't speak to much to my other classmates about the assignment other than confirming how bootstrap worked and how to lay out the columns correctly which was mostly with Nessa and Sam.


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No - everything should run fine by opening my index.html in Chrome :)
One issue that I could not resolve was in checking my animation.css file as it continued to give me a parse error which you can see from the screen shot. I googled around and still can not fix it so I hope that does not cause any problems on your end.
Another issue has to do with the color of the hamburger button on my nav-bar when the screen size shrinks in that I could not figure out how to get the inside lines to be the same color as the box itself and also when the hamburger menu is open it blocks some of the welcome text.
